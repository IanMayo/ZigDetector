# ZigDetector
Algorithm to detect target zigs

The following screenshot shows a summary of a single run of the algorithm.  The individual plots are described beneath the plot.

## Plot One
This is a plot of the course & speed of the ownship vessel. The green sectors mark the periods where ownship is on steady course & speed. They are labelled *Leg-1*, *Leg-2* and *Leg-3*.

## Plot Two
This is a plot of the error sums produced when experimenting with slicing the legs at different points. An line is also shown showing the error sum for the whole of that leg.

The vertical markers show the slice time that produces the minimum error score.

## Plot Three
This is a plot of the target course & speed. It is clear that the turn at around 12:37 has been identified correctly, but not the turn at around 01:22
