I wish to be able to determine the time periods when a vessel is on steady course and speed.  

I have measurements of course and speed against time in the file titled "Test Data Ownship.txt".

The data in this file is in these columns:
* Date/time (YYYYmmdd hhMMss)
* name (text - ignore)
* Position (x,y,z - ignore)
* Course (degrees)
* Speed (knots)
* Other columns to be ignored

As you can see from the data, there is noise in both course and speed data.

By eye, I would judge the steady course/speed periods to approximately be:
1400-1535
1601-1644
1709-1800

Yes, the data is of very poor quality.
